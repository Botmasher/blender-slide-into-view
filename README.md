# Slide into View

## Why this add-on?
I'm building this Blender project to help me perform a frequently-repeated animation task: transition an object into or out of the camera's field of view over time.

## Installation & Dependencies
This project was built for and tested with `Blender 2.79` running in `macOS 10.12.6`.

Steps to get started with this add-on:
-[ ] install a compatible version of [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
-[ ] download, fork or clone this project into either:
	- your Blender `addons`
	- or your `addons_contrib` folder
-[ ] run Blender
-[ ] open User Preferences > Add-ons
	- you may have to select the "Testing" toggle
-[ ] find and check this add-on
